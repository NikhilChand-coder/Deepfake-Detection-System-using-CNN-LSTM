Deepfake Detection System

Deepfake technology has rapidly evolved, enabling the creation of highly realistic fake videos and images. This project aims to detect deepfake media using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system can classify input images or videos as Real or Fake, helping to combat misinformation and digital forgery.

Features

Detects deepfake content in images and videos
Pretrained CNN models for feature extraction (e.g., Xception, EfficientNet)
Frame-by-frame video analysis for consistent predictions
Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, ROC–AUC, Precision, Recall)
Supports both CPU and GPU inference
Modular code for easy training and model replacement

Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
